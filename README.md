============================

This is aimed to test the BTLE day-to-day usefulness.

The app should simply display:
 * current speed
 * current crank frequency
 * total distance

Trip speed and distance would be nice as well.

The app should maintain a connection to the btle peripheral reliably.

There is a swift version for OSX and iOS for comparison purposes at https://github.com/deadfalkon/swift-simple-bike-computer.
